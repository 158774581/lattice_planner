# LatticePlanner
The LatticePlanner repository provides a move_base global planner plugin for a time-bounded A* lattice planner. The planner is designed to plan time dependent, dynamically feasible navigation paths for robots with differential drive constraints. It uses a dynamic cost map which is based on the ROS costmap representation from the costmap_2d package.
